This repository contains Wiki entries about Large Language models, see https://github.com/dcasota/ollama-scripts/wiki/Introduction-to-Ollama.

It also contains a first project called [privateGPT for ENSI docs](https://github.com/dcasota/ollama-scripts/tree/main/privateGPT%20for%20ENSI%20docs#readme). The project is an attempt make use of Ollama's langchain-python-rag-privateGPT for a large amount of pdf documents. Those pdf documents were published and are maintained by the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI).
